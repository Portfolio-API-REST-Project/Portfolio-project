# Portfolio-project
This is a project to create an API rest and crud with with typescript.

We used a json document as database and created six endpoints:

GET to get all the data in our json (as example, information we should include in our portfolio).
GET to get all our projects in our portfolio in our json.
GET to get only one project by its id.
POST to post a new project.
PUT to update information of a project.
DELETE to delete a project.

We used nestjs, typescript and node.
